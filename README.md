# LD-37 - Factory (One Room Theme)

We are creating a factory. You place machines and connect them with belts so the correct parts make their way to the final product. You need to manage money, maybe work contracts, and try to get rich.

## How-to help
- [http://collab.hardlydifficult.com/](http://collab.hardlydifficult.com/) to submit contributions.
- Use a fileshare like dropbox to link the content (or a git pull request).
- **Developers**: Request developer permissions on Gitlab, then you can submit pull requests with your changes.
- Mention in chat when something is posted for us to look at.
- **Do not change existing prefabs or scenes**... hard to resolve conflicts. Instead create a new scene or a new prefab demonstrating how to use your stuff.
